For this homework, I used two methods.
First one is to generate Random DNA sequence from lab01.
Using for loop, make two random DNA sequence.
Secondly make a method that count hamming distance bewteen two random DNAs.
This method needs to have two string which are two random DNAs.
And using if statement in for loop, we compare each substring of them with equals method.
and return integer for hamming distance number.
