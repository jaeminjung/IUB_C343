my method "getNeighbors()" works great. it go through all Nodes, and find out distance less than r.
it has helper function that called calculateD, it will calcuate the distance between node and dataG, and return the
boolean true if it is less than r.

if I run this in my laptop, it works fine. However somehow in the putty, putty doesnt let me compile KDtree.java file.
errors with to change type E value to int.
