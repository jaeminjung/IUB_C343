h. big-Theta( n * ((n-1) / 2))


1. an ADT for a two-dimensional array of integers unlike with one-dimensional array, it has rows and column. So compare with one-dimensional array, we need to add one more of index for element so that it works correctly.
for example, one dimensional array looks like : array[size] ,
however, for two dimensional array looks like : 2d-array[row_size][column_size]
for all operation, we need to include one more of index for column.
when we need to insert or delete or get  a new integer, we need to have row index and column index, and process the codes.
