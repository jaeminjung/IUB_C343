//
first, I made simple methods in Card.java for ADT and implement to MyCard.java.
Using for loop in initialize method, I create full Deck of cards,
and in drawRandomCard method, computer choose random number to pick an index of list that I made, and return with string value.
In main method I made instantiation to create new object that I can test codes.
and call drawRandomCard method in system.out.print method to see it works well or not.
